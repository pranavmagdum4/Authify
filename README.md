# Authify
This project implements user authentication and registration features using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in a full-stack application built with Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and MySQL. The primary focus is on enhancing security by mitigating common web vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
